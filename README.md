## **Project Overview**

TaxEase AI is a user-centric, conversational assistant that empowers individuals with simplified, AI-driven tax guidance. This project enables users to:

- **Understand tax regulations** via conversational responses.
- **Retrieve relevant tax documents** using a Vector Database.
- **Generate personalized insights** by fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for tax-specific scenarios.
- **Simplify complex processes** like document preprocessing, data embedding, and response generation.

## **Problem Statement**

Tax filing is inherently complex due to:
- The need to analyze extensive tax regulations and forms.
- Limited tools for personalized assistance in tax document management.
- Inefficiency in retrieving relevant tax-specific information.

TaxEase AI addresses these pain points by providing:
- **Automated document preprocessing** using tools like PyPDF.
- **Accurate and real-time assistance** via a fine-tuned LLM.
- **Seamless document retrieval** powered by Pinecone Vector Database.
